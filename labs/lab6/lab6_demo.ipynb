    "###  Some tips for collaborating on group project\n",
    "\n",
    "Best practice for collaborating on GitHub is to **avoid** situations where two people are independently **working on the same script**. When trying to push/pull changes to/from same origin branch, there will inevitably be **merge conflicts** that can be messy to untangle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaboration is also a little more complicated with `Jupyter notebooks` since running cells in the notebook will change execution count and output, even if the code and content appear identical. You are welcome to use other programs to write scripts (e.g. `Spyder`). \n",
    "\n",
    "General recommendation - **split up** the project into multiple **smaller scipts**, and have each person work on different components. For example, you could have one script that ingests files, reduces/manipulates the data (e.g., reprojection), then writes new files out to disk in \"analysis-ready\" format. Then a second notebook reads in those data and does some analysis, creates some plots, etc. If you can pass things back and forth between group members like this, you'll avoid conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, each team member can create separate notebooks with different filenames that both live in the shared repo. When another team member does some work and commits their notebook to the shared repo, you can can **pull changes**, open their notebook, select relevant cells, copy and paste into your notebook. One simple option with this model is for each group member to create and maintain a subdirectory within the repo where they will stage and modify their own notebooks for their component of the project."
