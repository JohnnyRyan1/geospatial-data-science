For these kind of tasks, we have to carefully inspect the API **documentation** to understand what functions are available and what keyword arguments they require."

    "Geocoding is the process of transforming an address (e.g. \"1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA\") into geographic coordinates (e.g. 37.423021, -122.083739). This is a hugely important part of mapping services like Google Maps and OpenStreetMap since it allows these services to place markers on a map, provide directions etc. There are many geocoding services but often they have a limit the number of free calls we can make. But if we're clever, we can geocode **unlimitedly** for **free** using Google Maps (https://www.google.com/maps) and automated web browsing. "
